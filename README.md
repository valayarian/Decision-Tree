# Decision-Tree

1. Implemented the Decision Tree Algorithm after extracting features from an image dataset with 2400 samples from 4 distinct classes, with images sized at 32x32x3, using pythonâ€™s open-source computer vision library
2. Binary and multi-class classification were performed using Gini Index, Information Gain as splitting criteria.
3. Implemented decision tree using scikit learn library, performed feature selection and grid search and studied
the effect of ccp alpha on regularizing the trees based on their accuracy on the validation set
